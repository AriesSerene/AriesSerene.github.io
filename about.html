			<h1><span>About</span> me!</h1>
			<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website. I am Stephanie Candy, currently a student at STI College or Systems Technology Institute College. My course is.. well it's quite obvious now isn't it since you're reading on the portfolio website that I coded, designed, and planned myself. My course is none other than Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, majoring in Web Development!</p>
			<p >This course isn't actually my first choice of course in college, I wasn't really planning on coding or making websites but the person who pushed me and inspired me to do so was none other than my brother, Ian Phillip Urata, currently a Senior Data Analyst himself. because of him, I found passion and perserverance in this course. It wasn't easy of course, there were times where I don't know what to do to solve a certain coding challenge, where I was stuck on a website that I was coding and don't know what to do next or where there's a ton of errors and I don't know how to fix them. Sleepless nights and breakdowns, I've experienced it all because in this course but you see, despite all of that, I didn't give up. After countless trial and errors I always seem to deliver a finished website where I know I can be proud of, It wasn't perfect but I know to myself that I inserted all my efforts and all my best into creating a responsive and fully working websites! which I know I can be proud of. </p>
			<p>I always give my best in whatever I do, insert effort and always thinking of countless of ways to improve them. Coding wasn't my passion at first but I learned to love it since it taught me to never give up and keep finding solutions to each problems that might come your way, every error comes a solution, you'll just have to search hard and find it! Again, I am Stephanie Candy Urata. Your future Web Developer.</p>
